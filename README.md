# ArtMaker
A simple ArtCreator made using Python Turtle inbuilt framework

Use 'space' to move forward by 25 steps
Use 'a' to to turn left by 45 degrees(Available angles: 45, 90, 135, 180, 225, 270, 315, 360)
Use 's' to stop drawing(this allows you to watch your drawing without the interference of the turtle in the middle
Use 'u' to undo last move
Use 't' to start drawing once again

Hope you love it!!
